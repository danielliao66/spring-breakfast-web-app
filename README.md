# spring-breakfast-web-app
### Introduction
Inspired by some order machines in some restaurants, this project implements a web application where people can order breakfast meals.
### Server side
Information about items in the menu, including names and prices, is stored in a database using MongoDB. To handle HTTP requests from the client side, Spring Web is utilized.
### Client side
With an interface powered by React, customers can view the menu and make orders accordingly. Orders are sent to the server side and further actions can be made.
